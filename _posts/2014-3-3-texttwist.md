title: Text Twist !
---

In this project we used six jumbled letters to build as many words as possible before time runs out. If a word that uses all the letters, one can advance to the next round! 
Our project was a game of TextTwist wherein certain alphabets are given and the player is supposed to arrange the words that seem meaningful to him. The words are stored in a dictionary and with every word that matches the word in the dictionary, points are given. Also there is a concept of timer, it keeps on decreasing. Since the maximum number of alphabets displayed is six, the entry to the next level is possible when the player enters the longest word using the given alphabets. 
For the project we have considered php, html, javascript and sqlite3.

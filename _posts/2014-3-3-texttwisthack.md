title: Text Twist Hack !
---

As a red team, for this project we were looking for vulnerabilities in the other teams' code
As we could access the code by returning the objects from that page, it was important to have a light version of security through obscurity of javascript code. Obfuscation provides a way to protect your code by making it unreadable using advanced algorithms. It was not readable and  could be converted back at any time.

To prevent the html attacks where could change the length of the text box, it was ensured that all variable output in a page were encoded before being returned to the end user. Encoding variable output substitutes HTML markup with alternate representations called entities. This could be a possible solution.
We could access the java script code. It gave us the code access and we could manipulate the code. We were able to change the value of counter and fiddle with the game. HTML injections were possible. We found out that they did not check the database everytime someone added a word.
